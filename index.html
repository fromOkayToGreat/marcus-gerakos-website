                    <h2>About Marcus</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since earning his bachelors' degree in music from the
                        University of California at Los Angeles in 1990, Marcus
                        Gerakos has enjoyed an eclectic and busy career in
                        music, from his collaborations with Grammy-winning
                        percussionist Alex Acuna to his recordings with
                        internationally-known reggae artist Avion Blackmon to
                        performances with Grammy-winning saxophone legend Justo
                        Almario and platinum-selling smooth-jazz pioneer John
                        Klemmer. He has performed in the near and far corners of
                        the world, from Canada and Mexico to Central America and
                        the Far East. He is recognized by many of his well-known
                        musical peers as one of the finest guitarists in the
                        business. He has recorded in a variety of settings and
                        has a long list of CD credits as a session player. He
                        has arranged and performed some of the classical
                        guitar's most demanding literature, including the 24
                        Caprices for Solo Violin by Nicolo Paganini, as well as
                        popular songs treated with intricate counterpoint and
                        harmonies reminiscent of pianist Bill Evans.

                        He has earned critical praise as a solo artist,
                        recording four albums (including "The Edge Of Wonder", a
                        duet project with woodwinds player Robert Kyle) and
                        garnering international airplay. Two songs he wrote and
                        arranged for the children‚Äôs charity project, ‚ÄúYes We
                        Serve; For The Children‚Äù, have enjoyed considerable
                        airplay in the U.S. and in Ghana, West Africa, where
                        funds are being raised to build schools and youth camps
                        for Ghanaian children. His 2011 release, ‚ÄúMarmalade
                        Skies: Songs of The Beatles, Vol. 1‚Äù, features many of
                        his well-known musical colleagues like Artie Webb,
                        considered by many to be the finest Latin jazz flautist
                        of his generation, and Francisco Loyo, arranger and
                        musical director for Latin pop superstar Luis Miguel.
                        ‚ÄúMarmalade Skies‚Äù and its predecessor, ‚ÄúAs Twilight
                        Approaches‚Äù (2009), are both available through Apple
                        Music, Amazon, Spotify, and most other major online
                        retailers.
